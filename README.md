# React To-Do List

The repository contains my implementation of the To-Do list app inpired by the first live coding of the [React 
Nanodegree Program](https://udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). 
This is a simple To-Do list app done in React.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing 
purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't 
have any installed on your system. 

* npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, 
you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

or

* Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
